The following JavaScript was used for an application built with the Sysdev Kalipso Mobile Application Generator.
The overall goal of the project was to build an application to be used on Windows CE devices that is capable of
issuing system commands to ping a web address and server and can scan 1D, 2D, and DataMatrix barcodes and parse 
them them based on specific barcode identifiers used by General Motors. The following code was used and tested in
